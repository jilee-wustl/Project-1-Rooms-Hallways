# Project 1: Rooms & Hallways
Interaction: Non-linear Narrative â€” Project 1: Rooms &amp; Hallways

Although it is now ubiquitous, the hyperlink is the most radical feature of the internet. You will consider how to use the hyperlink for creative ends. The ability to hyperlink web pages together allows for all kinds of complex new readings.Select a visual composition or a text. Determine a way to break your composition down into meaningful 'rooms' (paragraphs, sentences, words or blocks of imagery, etc...). Now weave these distinct units together using many html pages and hyperlinks 'hallways' to create a network. Consider allowing for user choice, branching structures, loops, etc (Fig 1)... The linking does not have to follow a linear sequence. See if you can produce new readings and new ways of traversing your composition. When linking different parts of the composition together, think of the meaning of each link and the experience that happens between spaces. What does it feel like to move between and through? How does time activate these spaces (immediate, delayed, slow, fast, etc)? How might you tease out deep-seated and unexpected patterns, or establish non-existing ones? Are they linking between similar content? Similar characters? Similar actions? Are the meaning of links consistent across all of your pages? Do you have different types of links? How could these different types of links be indicated?
